# SequelQC Figures from the test dataset

**summaryTable.txt** is an Microsoft Excel compatable table that has many statistics for all SMRTcells including number of reads,total  bases,  mean  and  median  read  length,  N50,  L50,  PSR,  and  ZOR.

**n50s.pdf** is a barplot of N50s for all read groups for all SMRTcells.

**l50s.pdf** is a barplot of L50s for all read groups for all SMRTcells.

**totalBasesBarplot.pdf** is a barplot of total bases for all read groups for all SMRTcells.

**ReadLenHists** is a folder containing histograms of read lengths for all read groups for each SMRTcell. 

**subreadSizesBoxplots.pdf** is a set of boxplots with N50s in blue for all SMRTcells.

**zors.pdf** is a plot of ZORS for all SMRTcells.

**psrs.pdf** is a plot of PSRS for all SMRTcells.

**Figures not present**:
Because the test dataset does not include scraps files the figures that SequelQC can produce that are not here are frequency plots of subreads per subedCLR, frequency plots of adapters per CLR and boxplots of subedCLR read lengths with N50s in blue.
